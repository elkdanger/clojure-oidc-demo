# clojure-oidc-example

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to perform a very basic
[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) flow using Clojure.

This sample contains configuration for two authorization servers: [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and Google. You can change between then by altering the configuration on line 18 of `auth.clj`:

You can use the radio buttons to change between Google and Auth0
authorization servers.

Details for the authorization servers are already provided, but try altering them to use your own, or even try to add another OIDC-supported authorization server!

## Usage

Both of the methods of starting the demo shown below start it in
development mode. This means any code you change and save will be hot
reloaded.

### Running from Lein
Run the app using Leiningen:

```sh
lein run 3000
```
### In a REPL

Start your REPL, for example:

``` sh
lein repl
```

You can then start the server using:

``` sh
user=> (go)
```

You can stop the server with:

``` sh
user=> (stop)
```
